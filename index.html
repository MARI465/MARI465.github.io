            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>My mission is to use what I've learned throughout the years and what I will learn to create a better place for my society using technology. 
                I wanna be a person who people can look up to and strive to be better. Through kindness and tireless effort I want to not only become successful 
                professionally but also mentally. Being balanced no matter what happens. After my death or retirement I want people to look back and say 
                “I'm glad we had him for as long as we did”.
